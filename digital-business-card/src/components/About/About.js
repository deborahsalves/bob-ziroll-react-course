            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Journalist with over 15 years of experience, I've worked most of my career in digital media, which meant dealing with HTML and, more recently, CSS. In 2017 I began customizing WordPress-based websites, and the experience led to the decision to transition into tech, which took place in 2021. I am currently studying System Analysis at Estácio de Sá and Front-End development at Codecademy and working as a junior front-end dev at Matinal. I mostly deploy marketing landing pages and develop dynamic features for the newspaper's website (HTML/CSS/JS/php and plugins ACF/Elementor). Previous experiences include reporter, editor and print designer (Terra, Zero Hora, Diário Gaúcho, Matinal).</p>
